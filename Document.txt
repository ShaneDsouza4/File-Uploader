- Install package multer
- Form must have 3 attributes
1. action=""
	Which URL the file must be uploaded to.
2. method="POST"
3. Encryption Type enctype="multipart/form-data"
	Form can have data, this attribute is needed for files.

<form action="/upload" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data"> 
        <input type="file" name="profileImage">
        <button type="submit" >Upload</button>
</form>


- URL Encoded is needed to parse FORM Data
app.use(express.urlencoded({extended: false}))

- Create folder "uploads"

- Create route
const upload = multer({dest: "uploads/"})
app.post("/upload", upload.single("profileImage") , (req,res)=>{
    console.log(req.body)
    console.log(req.file)

    return res.redirect("/");
})

profileImage is name in the input field

- The above method, won't allow to view the image so we can resolve by creating a DiskStorage Object
const storage = multer.diskStorage({
    destination: function (req, file, cb) {  //In which folder save the file. Null refers to NO Error
        cb(null, '/uploads') 
    }, 
    filename: function (req, file, cb) {
        return cb(null, `${Date.now()}-${file.originalname}`)
    }
})


const upload = multer({storage: storage})

- Save the req.file.path in the DB.
